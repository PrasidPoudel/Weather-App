🌤️ Weather App
Welcome to my Weather App! This is a simple yet functional application that displays current weather information using live data fetched from an API. The app is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and demonstrates core front-end development concepts such as DOM manipulation, API integration, and working with JSON data.
